A Mac app that will automatically renew your Kerberos tickets.

Kerberos is commonly used in corporate networks to authenticate at intranet websites and other internal services without entering password all the time. The most common example is Microsoft Active Directory domain.

Those who use a Mac in such environment will probably find this app really handy, as it spares you from manually refreshing the expired ticket every single day.

As an additional bonus, it will display a standard user notification when the password expires and provides a nice UI for changing it when that happens.
